# **Library vs. Framework**

Libraries provide predefined methods and classes that can be imported.

Aside from providing predefined methods and classes that, a framework provides a defined and possibly extensible template with defined points where the user plugs into or extends with their own code.

Their difference lies in the inversion of control where in libraries, the user decides when and where the function is called. In a framework, the control flow is pre-defined and the user plugs into these defined points with their own code.
